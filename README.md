# MonetIncentTask
Monetary Incentive Task for experimental purposes, developed at Pozna≈Ñ Laboratory of Affective Neuroscience
v1.0

## Progress
First version finished, now it is going to encounter cosmetical changes.

## Technologies
Psychopy3, Python3, Numpy

## Scope of functionalities
Code presented above is performing Monetary Incentive Task

Firstly there is trial that measures subject's responses, from which it creates a baseline for duration of stimuli

in block of experiment. Subject's task is to response before stimuli disappear.

Then it adapts to subject, making duration of stimuli shorter or longer dependantly on subject's responses,

thus the overall score is always advancing toward 50% for right and bad responses.
